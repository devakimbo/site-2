We can make him consume some food, rest for X number of hours, sniff some object, and so on. This is the definition of the class Human, and this class is used to create objects of type Human. Every object we create using this class will have this set of properties and methods.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s create a class Goblin.</p><p>As you can see, the Goblin class is very similar to Human. It has almost the same set of properties and methods. The only difference is goblins can play goblin chess while Human play regular chess. They also have different insurance numbers.</p><figure><img src=/posts/what-is-object-oriented-programming/images/diagram-2-Human-Goblin-1.jpg alt="UML2 class diagram for Human and Goblin types" srcset title="UML2 class diagram for Human and Goblin types" width="%!s(int=561)px" height="%!s(int=238)px"><noscript><img src=/posts/what-is-object-oriented-programming/images/diagram-2-Human-Goblin-1.jpg alt="UML2 class diagram for Human and Goblin types" srcset></noscript><figcaption>UML2 class diagram for Human and Goblin types</figcaption></figure><p>Because there are so many commonalities between these two classes, we can try to model it in a more object oriented way.</p><h3 id=inheritance>Inheritance <a class=header-link href=#inheritance onclick=app.showSnackbar(event)><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3><p>Now, as you see we created class Humanoid, which is a class that both classes Human and Goblin may inherit. We can move all the common properties and methods to the new class.</p><p>The class like Humanoid is called parent class or superclass for both Human and Goblin classes. The Human and Goblin classes now become subclasses or child classes of Humanoid. This is a simple inheritance scenario in object oriented programming.</p><figure><img src=/posts/what-is-object-oriented-programming/images/diagram-3-Inheritance-1.jpg alt="UML2 class diagram for with inheritance" srcset title="UML2 class diagram for with inheritance" width="%!s(int=581)px" height="%!s(int=366)px"><noscript><img src=/posts/what-is-object-oriented-programming/images/diagram-3-Inheritance-1.jpg alt="UML2 class diagram for with inheritance" srcset></noscript><figcaption>UML2 class diagram for with inheritance</figcaption></figure><p>Let&rsquo;s assume in our game the world has more species than just humans and goblins.

There are a lot of similarities between Humanoid and Animal, but we don&rsquo;t want to create an inheritance relationship between them. What we can do is to introduce another class that will be superclass for both Human and Animal.</p><h3 id=generalization>Generalization <a class=header-link href=#generalization onclick=app.showSnackbar(event)><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3><p>That&rsquo;s what we have got.

Because of that, these classes are called abstract; to communicate, they are not meant to be instantiated. We won&rsquo;t be creating any objects from them.</p><p>We can create as many levels of abstractions as want, but it should be justified. We don&rsquo;t want to complicate our app.</p><p>Our example shows that this multi-level hierarchy was necessary to achieve an optimal model that will work for us.

They are just figures. To wrap it up into a game, we need much more than that.</p><p>But let&rsquo;s keep things as simple as possible and assume we have all the pieces. To create the game we need some controller.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s create another class named Game, which will be our controller class.

It will control the game by delegating tasks like user interface, world rendering, characters rendering, physics, to other highly specialized classes.</p><p>The presented example is a very simplified model of object oriented programming, or shortly OOP that shows the entire concept of this paradigm.
