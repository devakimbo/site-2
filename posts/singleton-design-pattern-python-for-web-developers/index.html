What is the Singleton?  Singleton is a creational design pattern, that helps us make sure that our application has no more than one instance of a specific class.
That&rsquo;s very handy when we want to use the same object across the application, and when we need to have an easy access to it in any place in the code.
By keeping and reusing only one instance of the class, we reduce the application load time, memory consumption, code readability, and maintainability.
Thanks to this pattern, we also don&rsquo;t have to think about how we can access the instance. The solution to this problem is already build-in the design pattern.

Instead, we use the provided <code>instance</code> static method.

Sadly, because of that, many unexperienced developers overuse it by trying to adapt many not suitable classes to be Singleton.

It may be suitable only when you will need at most one instance of the class across the application, and only if you will need to have access to it in any place in the code.</p><p>If the scenario that you are considering doesn&rsquo;t match these two requirements, you definitely not need a Singleton.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion <a class=header-link href=#conclusion onclick=app.showSnackbar(event)><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h2><p>Singleton is one of the most widely known design patterns in the software development world.
