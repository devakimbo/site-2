What are design patterns?  Design patterns are keywords used by experienced developers to communicate the solutions to the problems.
They are like templates, ways of structuring the code in a way that is proven to solve a particular group of problems successfully.
They are like small and big elements that every application uses behind the scene.
Benefits of design patterns  Here are the most significant benefits of using design patterns.
Design patterns as communication language of PROs  Experienced developers know design patterns…
At least some of them…
At least they should.
When you speak with your colegues, you can make an analogy to specific design patterns to better describe your point. That way, it&rsquo;s far easier for your colleagues to imagine the solution you have on your mind.
