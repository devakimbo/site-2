That way, it&rsquo;s far easier for your colleagues to imagine the solution you have on your mind.</p><h3 id=design-patterns-as-solutions-to-common-problems>Design patterns as solutions to common problems</h3><p>Design patterns are abstractions that describe a common solution to a particular group of problems.</p><p>For example, instead of thinking how to solve that specific challenge, you can start by thinking about design patterns that are often used to solve these kinds of problems.</p><p>The more design patterns you know, and the better you understand them, the bigger chances are you will get inspired by one of them and find the optimal solution.</p><h3 id=design-patterns-as-time-savers>Design patterns as time savers</h3><p>While using a design pattern as a problem solver, you save time because pattern implementations are well known.</p><p>To find example implementation, you can simply ask Google by typing the pattern name and programming language, for example, &ldquo;singleton python&rdquo;. That will give you example implementations of <a href=/posts/singleton-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title=Singleton>Singleton</a> pattern written in Python.</p><h3 id=design-patterns-reduce-the-risk-of-making-errors>Design patterns reduce the risk of making errors</h3><p>Your code is also less likely to have bugs because you don&rsquo;t design the solution from scratch. Instead, you choose a solution that is proven and tested. But, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to test the implementation, with automated tests.</p><h2 id=type-of-design-patterns>Type of design patterns</h2><p>There are many types of design patterns suitable for different problem categories.</p><h3 id=creational-patterns>Creational patterns</h3><p>These patterns are used to deal with object creation tasks.</p><p>The common example is to use the Singleton pattern to make sure there is no more than one instance of the object in the application.</p><p>The most common creational patterns are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern title="Factory Method" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Factory Method</a>, <a href=/posts/abstract-factory-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title="Abstract Factory">Abstract Factory</a>, <a href=/posts/singleton-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title=Singleton>Singleton</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern title=Builder target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Builder</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern title=Prototype target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Prototype</a>, <a href=/posts/lazy-initialization-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title="Lazy Initialization">Lazy Initialization</a>.</p><h3 id=structural-patterns>Structural patterns</h3><p>Structural patterns describe how to combine objects and classes to assemble new structures.</p><p>For example, you can use the Adapter pattern to adapt class representing file to be used as a data source for database processing library.</p><p>The most common structural patterns are: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern title=Adapter target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Adapter</a>, <a href=http://decorator-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers title=Decorator target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Decorator</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern title=Facade target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Facade</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern title=Composite target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Composite</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern title=Proxy target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Proxy</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern title=Delegation target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Delegation</a>.</p><h3 id=behavioral-patterns>Behavioral patterns</h3><p>These kinds of patterns describe ways to implement interactions between different objects.</p><p>For example, you can implement multiple algorithms for list sorting using the Strategy pattern - one strategy per algorithm.</p><p>The most common behavioral patterns are: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern title="Chain of Responsibility" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Chain of Responsibility</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern title=Command target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Command</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern title=Iterator target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Iterator</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern title=Observer target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Observer</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern title=State target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">State</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern title=Strategy target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Strategy</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern title=Visitor target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Visitor</a>.</p><h3 id=architectural-patterns>Architectural patterns</h3><p>These kinds of patterns are used for solving problems on the architecture level.</p><p>For example, the common Model-View-Controller (shortly MVC) pattern is very often used to create applications where Model objects and Views are separated, and don&rsquo;t know about each other. The Controller is the component that uses Models and Views, while running application logic.</p><p>The most common architectural patterns are: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller title=MVC target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">MVC</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model title=Client-Server target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Client-Server</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object title=DAO target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">DAO</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object title=DTO target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">DTO</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design title=DDD target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">DDD</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_pattern title=Interceptor target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Interceptor</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control title="Inversion of Control" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Inversion of Control</a>.</p><h3 id=functional-patterns>Functional patterns</h3><p>These design patterns are used in functional programming.</p><p>The most common functional patterns are: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29 title=Closure target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Closure</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28computer_programming%29 title=Generator target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Generator</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying title=Currying target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Currying</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_%28computer_science%29 title="Function Composition" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Function Composition</a>.</p><h3 id=concurrency-patterns>Concurrency patterns</h3><p>These design patterns are used to solve problems related to concurrent access to the application.</p><p>For example, you can use the Thread-Local Storage pattern to create separate data storage for every started thread.</p><p>The most common concurrency patterns are: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object title="Immutable Object" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Immutable Object</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage title="Thread-Local Storage" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Thread-Local Storage</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writer_lock title="Read-Write Lock" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Read-Write Lock</a>.</p><h2 id=should-i-learn-design-patterns>Should I learn design patterns?</h2><p>Well, if you want to be perceived as an expert programmer, then YES, 100%!</p><p>You should know at least some of the most common design patterns.</p><p>There are not many things more disappointing in the coding world than the expert developer that doesn&rsquo;t have a clue how common design pattern works.</p><p>So if you are new to the design pattern world, please do yourself a favor and learn at least the most common ones like <a href=/posts/singleton-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title=Singleton>Singleton</a>, <a href=/posts/decorator-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title=Decorator>Decorator</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern title=Prototype target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Prototype</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern title="Factory Method" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Factory Method</a>, <a href=/posts/abstract-factory-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title="Abstract Factory">Abstract Factory</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter title=MVP target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">MVP</a>, <a href=/posts/lazy-initialization-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ title="Lazy Initialization">Lazy Initialization</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern title=Strategy target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Strategy</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern title=Builder target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Builder</a>, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern title=Observer target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Observer</a>.</p><p>Yes, this list has more than one item, but those patterns are the ones every no beginner software developer should know.</p><p>Learning design patterns will bring you to the world of new ways of creative problem-solving.
