What is the Lazy Initialization design pattern?  The Lazy Initialization, also called Lazy Loading is a very simple but powerful a creational design pattern that allows us to delay initialization of the object until it is needed.
It is used to increase application performance, speed up the initialization process, and reduces resource consumption: bandwidth, database load, RAM, and CPU usage.
Using Lazy Initialization in Python  Let&rsquo;s assume we have implemented an online shop where we have an object Customer that may have a list of orders he created. Without Lazy Loading, we would probably have an entire list of orders retrieved from the database every time we will create object Customer. Even if there were no orders in the customer account, we would query the database."><meta name=author content="Dev Akimbo"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.79.0-DEV"><meta name=robots content="INDEX, FOLLOW"><link rel=preload href=https://devakimbo.com/css/styles.min.1d910ca69079133002407b8bb6587ac271bad64b59d35f38135246328720e3d1.css as=style media=screen onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'"><noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://devakimbo.com/css/styles.min.1d910ca69079133002407b8bb6587ac271bad64b59d35f38135246328720e3d1.css></noscript><link rel=preload href=https://devakimbo.com/css/page-post.min.dac5baae6095b0291b25e3e8b0c3166638d390d6f4295885c25c2b15f84b6610.css as=style media=screen onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'"><noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://devakimbo.com/css/page-post.min.dac5baae6095b0291b25e3e8b0c3166638d390d6f4295885c25c2b15f84b6610.css></noscript><link rel=canonical href=https://devakimbo.com/posts/lazy-initialization-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/><link rel=home href=https://devakimbo.com/posts/lazy-initialization-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/><link rel=alternate href=https://devakimbo.com/posts/lazy-initialization-design-pattern-python-for-web-developers/ hreflang=x-default><link rel=preconnect href=https://ssl.gstatic.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://www.gstatic.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.googleapis.com><link rel=preload href=/webfonts/fa-brands-400.woff2 as=font crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=preload href=/webfonts/fa-solid-900.woff2 as=font crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=preload href=/fonts/Cabin/static/Cabin-SemiBold.ttf as=font crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=preload href=/fonts/Cabin/static/Cabin-Regular.ttf as=font crossorigin=anonymous><meta property="og:title" content="Lazy Initialization Design Pattern Python for Web Developers"><meta property="og:description" content="In this post, you will learn what Lazy Initialization design pattern is, how to implement it using Python, when it makes sense to use it, and when it will be an overkill.
