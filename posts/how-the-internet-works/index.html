Client - server model  Simply put, the Internet works in a client-server manner.
The client is our web browser like Chrome or Safari, and the server is an HTTP server. HTTP is the protocol used for communication between them.
The Internet is built with a global, vast network of data centers connected together via optical fiber wires.
Data centers host HTTP servers, databases, and other things.

Not really magical, but what happens undercovers the browser don&rsquo;t know what does amazon.com means, so he has to ask nearest DNS server, domain name resolution server - and there are networks of them as well - for IP address of the amazon.com. Because the browser needs an IP address, he is not happy with just having a domain name."><meta name=author content="Dev Akimbo"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.79.0-DEV"><meta name=robots content="INDEX, FOLLOW"><link rel=preload href=https://devakimbo.com/css/styles.min.1d910ca69079133002407b8bb6587ac271bad64b59d35f38135246328720e3d1.css as=style media=screen onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'"><noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://devakimbo.com/css/styles.min.1d910ca69079133002407b8bb6587ac271bad64b59d35f38135246328720e3d1.css></noscript><link rel=preload href=https://devakimbo.com/css/page-post.min.dac5baae6095b0291b25e3e8b0c3166638d390d6f4295885c25c2b15f84b6610.css as=style media=screen onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'"><noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://devakimbo.com/css/page-post.min.dac5baae6095b0291b25e3e8b0c3166638d390d6f4295885c25c2b15f84b6610.css></noscript><link rel=canonical href=https://devakimbo.com/posts/how-the-internet-works/><link rel=home href=https://devakimbo.com/posts/how-the-internet-works/><link rel=alternate href=https://devakimbo.com/posts/how-the-internet-works/ hreflang=x-default><link rel=preconnect href=https://ssl.gstatic.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://www.gstatic.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.googleapis.com><link rel=preload href=/webfonts/fa-brands-400.woff2 as=font crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=preload href=/webfonts/fa-solid-900.woff2 as=font crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=preload href=/fonts/Cabin/static/Cabin-SemiBold.ttf as=font crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=preload href=/fonts/Cabin/static/Cabin-Regular.ttf as=font crossorigin=anonymous><meta property="og:title" content="How the Internet Works"><meta property="og:description" content="If you are a web developer, many people will expect that you know how the web works.
