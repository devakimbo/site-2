Client - server model  Simply put, the Internet works in a client-server manner.
The client is our web browser like Chrome or Safari, and the server is an HTTP server. HTTP is the protocol used for communication between them.
The Internet is built with a global, vast network of data centers connected together via optical fiber wires.
Data centers host HTTP servers, databases, and other things.
